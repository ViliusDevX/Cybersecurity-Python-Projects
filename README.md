## 📚 Skills Practiced

🐍 Python scripting — writing modular, reusable, and well-structured Python code for automation and analysis

📁 Data parsing & file handling — working with .txt, .json, .yaml, .csv, and log formats (Suricata, DNS, etc.)

🔐 Cryptography & encoding — AES (CBC mode), Caesar/XOR ciphers, Base64, JWT parsing, encryption padding.

🕵️‍♂️ Log analysis & rule matching — building a rule-based SIEM, scanning logs for indicators using YAML patterns

🌐 Networking and security scanning — port scanning, IP geolocation, HTTP header auditing, email spoofing analysis

🛡️ Security fundamentals — password strength, secure protocols (TLS/SMB), SPF/DKIM/DMARC, cookie flags, token validation

📊 Alert reporting & exporting — generating structured outputs (.csv, .json) from matched security alerts

🖥️ GUI application development — modern interfaces using Tkinter and ttkbootstrap for tools like encoders, scanners, and log analyzers.

📦 File and system inspection — scanning files for integrity, embedded indicators, and unpacking nested content.
