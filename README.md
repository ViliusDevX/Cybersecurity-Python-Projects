| Project                      | Description                                                                                               |
| ---------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `password-strength-checker`  | CLI + GUI tool to analyze password complexity, entropy, and common password usage                         |
| `hash-cracker`               | GUI-based tool that performs offline dictionary attacks on hashes using `rockyou.txt` or custom wordlists |
| `caesar-xor-encoder-decoder` | GUI-based Caesar and XOR encoder/decoder with tabbed interface and flexible key/shift input               |
| `ip-info-checker`            | GUI tool to fetch and display IP geolocation, ASN, ISP, and basic risk insights using public APIs         |
| `http-header-analyzer`       | GUI-based HTTP response header analyzer that highlights missing security headers and misconfigurations    |
| `email-spoof-checker`        | GUI tool that checks SPF, DKIM, and DMARC records to estimate a domain’s email spoofing protection score  |
| `port-scanner`               | Multi-threaded GUI-based port scanner with banner grabbing                                                |
| `jwt-parses`                 | GUI tool to decode JWT tokens, display header and payload, check expiration, and verify HS256 signatures  |
| *More coming soon...*        | Plans include SIEM analyzers, local device scanners, and automated OSINT tools                            |
